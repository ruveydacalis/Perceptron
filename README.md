# Perceptron
The training set inperceptron.datacontains the Iris dataset limited toIris-setosa and Iris-versicolor. perceptron.test.data contains  the  test  set.   Implement  the perceptron and train it to classify the two species.  Test with the test set and output the acuracy.
### The program should have the following capabilities:
#### Loading any dataset in csv format, where the last column is the class.  The numberof weights should be adjusted to the dataset.  (!!)
#### Picking the learning rate.
#### Simple UI to manually input vectors to classify.
